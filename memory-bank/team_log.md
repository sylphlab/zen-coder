**Subject:** Initial Plan for UI Review and Refactor Task

**Details:**
## Task: Review and Refactor UI Views

**Goal:** Systematically review and refactor UI views/components in `webview-ui/src` to address layout inconsistencies and messy details after a major overhaul.

**Plan:**
1.  **Identify Views/Components:** List main UI elements based on `webview-ui/src/pages` and `webview-ui/src/components`, using open tabs and file structure as guides.
    *   Pages: `HomePageRedirector.tsx`, `ChatPage.tsx`, `ChatListPage.tsx`, `SettingPage.tsx`.
    *   Components: `InputArea.tsx`, `ConfirmationDialog.tsx`, `MessagesArea.tsx`, `ModelSelector.tsx`, `ui/CustomSelect.tsx`, `settings/*`.
2.  **Prioritize:** Start with core user-facing views: `ChatPage.tsx` and its components (`MessagesArea.tsx`, `InputArea.tsx`, `ModelSelector.tsx`), then `SettingPage.tsx` and its components.
3.  **Review Criteria:** Layout (alignment, spacing - UnoCSS), clarity, component structure, code quality (TS, React patterns, Nanostores).
4.  **Refactor Iteratively:** Apply fixes file-by-file or component-by-component.
5.  **Log:** Update Memory Bank (Now `team_log.md`, `progress.md`) throughout.
