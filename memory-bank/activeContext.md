# Active Context

## Current Focus
Preparing to commit the current state of the MVP and transition to a new task based on user feedback.

## Recent Changes
- Completed core MVP functionality (chat loop, streaming, tools, API key storage/setting, provider instantiation).
- Refined `search` tool to use an MCP executor bridge (placeholder).
- Received user feedback:
    - Clarified that the current UI uses plain JS/HTML/CSS, not a framework like React.
    - Acknowledged the importance of implementing model selection UI.

## Next Steps
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect MVP completion and feedback.
- Commit the current code state to Git.
- Await new task instructions from the user (likely focusing on UI improvements like model selection).

## Active Decisions
- MVP core logic is considered complete for this phase.
- UI framework choice (plain JS/HTML/CSS) aligns with initial MVP scope but can be revisited.
- Model selection UI is identified as a key next feature.
