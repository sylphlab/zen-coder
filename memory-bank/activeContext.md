# Active Context

## Current Focus
Debugging and refining Vercel AI SDK stream parsing logic.

## Recent Changes
- **Tool Refactoring & Expansion:** (Completed previously)
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Initial):** Corrected stream parsing logic in `src/extension.ts` to handle Vercel AI SDK's data stream format (with prefixes like `0:`) using Web Streams API.
- **UI Update (Tool Status):** Updated `webview-ui/src/app.tsx` to handle `toolStatusUpdate` messages and display tool execution status. Added corresponding CSS styles in `webview-ui/src/app.css`.
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Enhanced):** Updated stream parsing logic in `src/extension.ts` to handle additional Vercel AI SDK prefixes (`d:`, `e:`, `f:`) reported by user.
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Refined):** Further refined stream parsing logic in `src/extension.ts`:
    - Correctly handle `0:` prefixes followed by raw text chunks (not JSON) by sending them directly to the UI.
    - Gracefully handle `d:` prefixes followed by JSON objects lacking a `type` property (e.g., finishReason messages) by logging them without causing errors or warnings.
- **AiService Refactoring:** (Completed previously)
- **Configuration Update:** (Completed previously)
- **Previous:** Project renamed to Zen Coder; Vercel AI SDK enhancements (multi-step, error handling, repair) applied.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.
- Commit refined stream parsing fix.
- **Next:** Thorough testing of stream parsing with different models/responses.
- Attempt completion.

## Active Decisions
- Toolset successfully refactored into a modular structure under `src/tools/`.
- Numerous new tools added across filesystem, utils, system, and vscode categories.
- `AiService` now utilizes the modular tool structure.
- Configuration in `package.json` updated for new tools.
- Stream parsing logic iteratively refined to handle various Vercel AI SDK stream formats observed in testing.
