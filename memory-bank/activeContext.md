# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Verify Message Display Fix:** Testing if correcting the `$isStreamingResponse` store definition and adding a dynamic `key` to the `ReactMarkdown` component resolves the issue where AI responses were not displaying despite store updates.

## Next Steps
1.  **Test Message Display:** Verify that messages now appear correctly in the chat view after sending. Check logs if it fails.
2.  **Address Timeout (If Needed):** If issues persist, investigate increasing the request timeout in `webview-ui/src/utils/communication.ts`.
3.  **Implement Incremental PubSub Updates (Backend + Frontend):** Resume delta implementation if message display is confirmed fixed.
4.  **Implement Pub/Sub for Suggested Actions:** Replace the temporary local state.
5.  **Resume Image Upload:** Continue implementation.
6.  **Compliance Review & VS Code Tool Enhancements:** As before.

## Recent Changes (Message Display Debugging)
+ **Corrected `$isStreamingResponse` Store (`webview-ui/src/stores/chatStores.ts`):** Reinstated a minimal, non-functional `fetch` config to satisfy TypeScript type requirements after the initial removal caused an error. This ensures the store doesn't start in an error state and can receive PubSub updates.
+ **Added Key to `ReactMarkdown` (`webview-ui/src/components/MessagesArea.tsx`):** Added a dynamic `key` prop based on text content slice to potentially force re-renders during streaming. Corrected syntax errors introduced by the `replace_in_file` tool in the previous step.
+ **(Previous changes: Delta Implementation, Dependency Injection, Settings UI Refactoring, Jotai Removal, Bug Fixes, etc.)**

## Active Decisions
- **Communication Pattern:** ReqRes + PubSub (pushing deltas now for history/sessions).
- **Store Creation Utility:** Use `createStore` with `dependsOn`.
- **State Management:** Nanostores primary, local state for UI specifics.
- **(Previous decisions remain largely valid unless superseded above)**
