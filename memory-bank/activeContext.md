# Active Context

## Current Focus
Refactoring AI Provider logic in `AiService`.

## Recent Changes
- **Refactored AI Provider Logic:**
    - Created `src/ai/providers` directory.
    - Defined `AiProvider` interface in `src/ai/providers/providerInterface.ts`.
    - Created individual provider modules (`anthropicProvider.ts`, `googleProvider.ts`, `openRouterProvider.ts`, `deepseekProvider.ts`) implementing the interface.
    - Implemented dynamic model fetching for OpenRouter in `openRouterProvider.ts`.
    - Created `src/ai/providers/index.ts` to export all providers and a lookup map.
    - Refactored `AiService` (`_getProviderInstance`, `resolveAvailableModels`) to use the new provider structure.
    - Removed old SDK imports and helper methods (`fetchOpenRouterModels`, `hardcodedModels`) from `AiService`.
    - Created `src/utils/dynamicImport.ts` helper for `node-fetch` in OpenRouter provider.
- **Added Settings Provider Search:** (Previous change)
    - Added a search input field to `SettingPage.tsx`.
    - Implemented state (`searchQuery`) and filtering logic (`filteredProviders`, `useMemo`) to dynamically filter the displayed provider list based on the search query (matching name or key).
- **Implemented OpenRouter Model Fetching:** (Previous change)
    - Added `fetchOpenRouterModels` method to `AiService`.
    - Updated `resolveAvailableModels` to use the fetched models.
- **Implemented Settings API Key Input:** (Previous change)
    - Added UI elements and message handling for setting API keys in `SettingPage.tsx` and `src/extension.ts`.
- **Restored Settings Page:** (Previous change)
    - Updated `SettingPage.tsx` props and rendering logic.
    - Exported types from `App.tsx`.
    - Passed props in `App.tsx` route.
- **Added Nanostores:** (Previous change)
    - Installed `nanostores` and `@nanostores/preact` dependencies.
- **Added GSAP:** (Previous change)
    - Installed `gsap` dependency.
- **Integrated UnoCSS:** (Previous change)
    - Installed `unocss`, `@unocss/vite`, `@unocss/reset`.
    - Configured Vite (`webview-ui/vite.config.ts`).
    - Created UnoCSS config file (`webview-ui/uno.config.ts`).
    - Imported UnoCSS styles in `webview-ui/src/main.tsx`.
- **Implemented Routing:** (Previous change)
    - Installed `wouter`.
    - Created `SettingPage.tsx` and `ChatPage.tsx` components.
    - Updated `webview-ui/src/app.tsx` for routing.
    - Replaced settings modal with `/settings` route.
    - Updated `showSettings` message handler.
- **Relaxed Development CSP:** (Previous change)
    - Added `'unsafe-eval'` to the `script-src` directive in the development mode Content Security Policy within `src/extension.ts` (`getWebviewContent`). This was to test if Vite's HMR script execution was being blocked.
- **Fixed Vite Port File Path:**
    - Corrected the path used in `src/extension.ts` (`getWebviewContent`) to read the `.vite.port` file from the project root directory.
- **Fixed `package.json` Inconsistency:**
    - Updated `activationEvents`, `contributes.views`, and removed obsolete `menus`, `commands` to align with `WebviewViewProvider`. Resolved "No data provider registered" error.
- **Vite Port Discovery (Initial Implementation):**
    - Modified `webview-ui/vite.config.ts` to write the running dev server port to `.vite.port`.
    - Modified `src/extension.ts` to read the port during development.
- **Tool Refactoring & Expansion:** (Completed previously)
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Comprehensive):** (Completed previously)
- **Removed Deprecated `StreamData`:** (Completed previously)
- **Standardized `streamText` Usage:** (Completed previously)
- **Corrected Stream Handling:** (Completed previously)
- **Corrected Stream Return Value:** (Completed previously)
- **UI Update (Tool Status):** (Completed previously, but status updates are now disabled).
- **AiService Refactoring:** (Completed previously)
- **Configuration Update:** (Completed previously)
- **Previous:** Project renamed to Zen Coder; Vercel AI SDK enhancements applied.
- **UI Tool Display Refinement:** (Completed previously)
- **`uuidGenerateTool` Enhancement & Progress:** (Completed previously)
- **Tool Result Handling Clarification:** (Completed previously)
- **Merged Settings UI into Chat Webview (Complete):** (Completed previously)

## Next Steps
- **Current Task:** Update Memory Bank and commit AI Provider refactoring.
- **Previous:** Refactor AI Provider logic in `AiService` and create provider modules.
- **Future:** Implement model selection persistence in Chat UI.
- **Future:** Implement model selection persistence in Chat UI.
- **Future:** Implement chat history persistence.
- **Future:** Consider applying progress update pattern to other tools.
- **Future:** Consider refining UI display for complex tool results.
## Debugging Notes
- **AI Provider Logic Refactored:** `AiService` now uses modular providers under `src/ai/providers`. Model creation and listing logic is delegated to individual provider modules.
- **OpenRouter Models Fetched Dynamically:** Logic moved to `openRouterProvider.ts`.
- **Settings Provider Search Added:** Users can now filter the provider list in the settings page (Previous).
- **API Key Input Added:** Settings page allows setting API keys (Previous).
- **Settings Page Restored:** Moved rendering logic and passed necessary props (Previous).
- **Nanostores Added:** Installed the library and Preact integration (Previous).
- **GSAP Added:** Installed the library (Previous).
- **UnoCSS Integrated:** Added dependencies, Vite plugin, config, and imports (Previous).
- **Routing Implemented:** Added `wouter` and page components (Previous).
- **Relaxed Dev CSP:** Added `'unsafe-eval'` to `script-src` for testing HMR compatibility (Previous).
- **Fixed Vite Port File Path:** Corrected path in `src/extension.ts`.
- **Fixed "No data provider registered" Error:** Resolved by correcting `package.json`.
- **Fixed Vite 504 Error (Chat UI):** (Resolved previously)
- **Fixed Chat UI Hang:** (Resolved previously)
- **Fixed `getCurrentModelId` Return Type:** (Resolved previously)
- **Added Debug Logs (API Keys):** (Kept)
- **Verified Model Resolver Logic:** (Kept)
- **Corrected `_getProviderInstance` Logic:** (Kept)
- **Activity Bar Entry:** Changed to direct Webview View.
- **Verified Chat UI Code:** (Kept)
