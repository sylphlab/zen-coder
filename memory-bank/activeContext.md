# Active Context

## Current Focus
Debugging and finalizing Vercel AI SDK stream parsing logic.

## Recent Changes
- **Tool Refactoring & Expansion:** (Completed previously)
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Initial):** Corrected stream parsing logic in `src/extension.ts` to handle Vercel AI SDK's data stream format (with prefixes like `0:`) using Web Streams API.
- **UI Update (Tool Status):** Updated `webview-ui/src/app.tsx` to handle `toolStatusUpdate` messages and display tool execution status. Added corresponding CSS styles in `webview-ui/src/app.css`.
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Enhanced):** Updated stream parsing logic in `src/extension.ts` to handle additional Vercel AI SDK prefixes (`d:`, `e:`, `f:`) reported by user.
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Refined):** Further refined stream parsing logic in `src/extension.ts` to handle `0:` prefixes followed by raw text chunks (incorrectly) and `d:` prefixes with typeless JSON.
- **Fixed Stream Parsing (Final):** Corrected the handling of `0:` prefixes in `src/extension.ts`. It now correctly assumes the content is always JSON (either a string or an object) and parses it accordingly. If the parsed result is a string, it sends the *decoded* string to the UI, fixing the extra quotes issue.
- **AiService Refactoring:** (Completed previously)
- **Configuration Update:** (Completed previously)
- **Previous:** Project renamed to Zen Coder; Vercel AI SDK enhancements (multi-step, error handling, repair) applied.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.
- Commit final stream parsing fix.
- **Next:** Test stream parsing thoroughly.
- Attempt completion.

## Active Decisions
- Toolset successfully refactored into a modular structure under `src/tools/`.
- Numerous new tools added across filesystem, utils, system, and vscode categories.
- `AiService` now utilizes the modular tool structure.
- Configuration in `package.json` updated for new tools.
- Stream parsing logic iteratively refined and finalized to correctly handle various Vercel AI SDK stream formats, including JSON-encoded strings.
