# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Implemented Optimistic Updates for User Messages:** Modified `ChatView.tsx`'s `handleSend` function to immediately add the user's message to the `$activeChatHistory` store before sending the request to the backend. Added more logging to diagnose why updates might not be rendering. Made `createStore.ts` more resilient to errors.

## Next Steps
1.  **Test User Message Display (Optimistic Update):** Verify that user messages now appear instantly in the UI after sending. **(Next Task)**
2.  **Test Streaming Display Fix:** Verify that AI responses stream correctly (related to previous buffering/store fixes).
3.  **Test Suggested Actions:** Verify that suggested actions appear correctly after an AI response and function as expected (sending messages, running tools, filling input).
3.  **Test History Persistence & Review Logs:** Confirm completed/stopped messages persist and review logs added to `WorkspaceStateManager` if needed.
4.  **Test Delta Updates:** Manual testing still pending.
5.  **Resume Image Upload:** Continue implementation.
6.  **Compliance Review & VS Code Tool Enhancements:** As before.
7.  **Address Timeout (If Needed):** Monitor if timeouts occur.

## Recent Changes (Optimistic Updates & Error Handling)
+ **Added Optimistic Update:** Modified `ChatView.tsx` `handleSend` to call `$activeChatHistory.set()` locally before `sendMessageMutate`.
+ **Added Logging:** Added console logs in `ChatView.tsx` `handleSend` around the optimistic update step.
+ **Improved Store Error Handling:** Modified `createStore.ts` to attempt `handleUpdate` even if the store was previously in an 'error' state.
+ **Fixed Store Type Mismatch:** Corrected `handleUpdate` signature in `activeChatHistoryStore.ts`.
+ **Fixed Streaming Race Condition:** (Previous attempt) Added chunk buffering logic to `webview-ui/src/stores/activeChatHistoryStore.ts`.
+ **(Previous changes: Suggested Actions Pub/Sub, Error Correction, Persistence Fixes, etc.)**

## Active Decisions
+ **Optimistic Update Strategy:** Manually add user message to `$activeChatHistory` store in `handleSend` before calling backend.
+ **Store Error Recovery:** Allow stores in 'error' state to potentially recover by processing new updates via `handleUpdate`.
+ **Streaming Fix:** (Retained from previous step) Use a buffer (`Map`) in the frontend history store (`activeChatHistoryStore.ts`) to temporarily hold chunks for messages whose frames haven't arrived yet. Apply buffered chunks when the message frame is added.
+ **Accept Persistence Limitation:** Acknowledge limitations regarding persistence during abrupt window reloads.
+ **Persistence Trigger:** Final save triggered correctly on normal finish and manual abort via forced `touchChatSession`.
+ **In-Memory Update During Stream:** Correctly implemented.
+ **Communication Pattern:** ReqRes + PubSub.
+ **State Management:** Nanostores primary.
+ **(Previous decisions remain largely valid unless superseded above)**
