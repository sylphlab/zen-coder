# Active Context

## Current Focus
Commit fix for UI rendering error (`msg.content.map`) and prepare for next task (UnoCSS styling).

## Recent Changes
- **Removed Deprecated Dependency:** Removed `@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit` from root `package.json`.
- **Applied UnoCSS Styling:** Added utility classes to `App.tsx` (layout, chat elements) and `SettingPage.tsx` for basic styling and dark mode support. Fixed related JSX errors.
- **Fixed UI Rendering Error:** Corrected message rendering logic in `App.tsx` to handle both string and array types for `msg.content`, resolving `msg.content.map is not a function` error.
- **Added Tool Result History Saving:** Modified `extension.ts` stream processing to create and save `role: 'tool'` messages to history when tool results are received.
- **Fixed History Format Error:** Corrected `_chatHistory` type in `extension.ts` to `CoreMessage[]` and ensured user messages are converted to the correct format before being added, resolving `AI_InvalidPromptError`.
- **Fixed UI Infinite Loop:** Adjusted `useEffect` dependencies and removed automatic model re-fetch on status update in `App.tsx` to prevent loop.
- **Implemented Chat History Persistence:**
    - Extension (`extension.ts`) now loads/saves history using `context.globalState`.
    - History is passed to `AiService` and sent to webview (`App.tsx`) on load.
    - `AiService` refactored to return final assistant message via promise for saving.
- **Implemented Model Selection Persistence:** Used `vscode.getState()`/`setState()` in `App.tsx` to save and restore the last selected model ID across webview reloads.
- **Fixed Stream End Handling:** Added explicit `streamFinished` message from backend (`extension.ts`) to frontend (`App.tsx`) to reliably stop the UI streaming indicator.
- **Fixed State Synchronization:** Ensured Chat UI model list updates correctly after API key changes in Settings UI. (Triggered model re-fetch on provider status change in `App.tsx`).
- **Fixed Model List Refresh (`App.tsx`):**
    - Modified `useEffect` hook in `App.tsx` to re-trigger `getAvailableModels` message when `providerStatus` is updated (e.g., after setting/deleting an API key), ensuring the chat UI's model list reflects newly available providers.
