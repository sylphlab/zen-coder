## Current Focus
Finalizing documentation and preparing for task completion after fixing the webview content loading issue.

## Recent Changes
- Completed core MVP functionality.
- Refactored Webview UI to Vite + Preact.
- Implemented Model Selection UI and logic.
- Updated relevant files (`package.json`, `src/extension.ts`, `webview-ui/*`) for Vite + Preact.
- **Fixed Webview Loading Issue:** Modified `getWebviewContent` in `src/extension.ts` to correctly load assets (JS/CSS) from the Vite build output (`dist/webview`) using `webview.asWebviewUri` and adjusted CSP/nonce injection. Updated `localResourceRoots` accordingly.

## Next Steps
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the fix.
- Commit the latest changes.
- Attempt completion.

## Active Decisions
- Webview UI successfully refactored and loading correctly.
- Model selection functionality implemented.
