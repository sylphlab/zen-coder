# Project Progress

## What Works
- **Message Display:** Fixed issues where messages (including streamed text) were not appearing correctly.
- **Persistence (Completed Messages):** AI responses that finish streaming completely are now reliably saved and persist after reloading.
- **Persistence (Manually Stopped Messages):** Explicitly triggering a save when "Stop Generation" is used persists the partial message state (subject to async save completion before termination).
- **Fixed Chat Loading/Redirect Issue:** Consolidated logic in `ChatPage.tsx`.
- **Fixed Reactivity Issue (Chat History):** Ensured immutable updates in `HistoryManager.getHistory`.
- **Fixed Settings Page Input:** Resolved input interference.
- **Restored Tool Settings Section:** Re-enabled in settings UI.
- **Frontend State Refactoring (Nanostores using `createStore`):** Completed.
- **Routing (`@nanostores/router`):** Implemented.
- **Pub/Sub & Request/Response:** Unified communication pattern established. Backend pushes delta updates for history/sessions.
- **Stream Processing:** Handles mixed stream parts, pushes UI updates via PubSub, updates in-memory state during stream. Fixed race condition where chunks could arrive before the message frame, preventing live display (`activeChatHistoryStore.ts`).
- **Multi-Chat Backend Structure:** Implemented.
- **Multi-Chat Frontend Basics:** Implemented.
- **Model ID Handling:** Correctly uses separate `providerId` and `modelId`.
- **VS Code Tools (Partial):** Several tools implemented, filesystem tools refactored.
- **MCP Management:** `McpManager`, file-based config, status UI.
- **Stream Cancellation:** Implemented via `abortCurrentStream`, triggers save attempt.
- **Image Upload (Partial):** UI implemented, data sending logic exists. Backend needs review.
- **Message Actions:** Copy/Delete implemented.
- **UI Basics:** Markdown/Syntax Highlighting, basic styling.
- **Fixed MCP Server Settings UI:** Optimistic updates, status display.
- **Refactored `AiService`, `HistoryManager`, `ChatSessionManager`, `ConfigResolver`, `WorkspaceStateManager`.**
- **Fixed `$isStreamingResponse` Store (`webview-ui/src/stores/chatStores.ts`):** Corrected definition.
- **History Persistence Fixes:** Ensured in-memory state updated during stream, forced save on completion/manual abort. Accepted limitation for abrupt reloads. Added diagnostic logging. Fixed related TS errors. Rewrote corrupted state/store files (`chatStores.ts`, `workspaceStateManager.ts`, `subscriptionManager.ts`).
- **Suggested Actions Pub/Sub:** Implemented backend push via `SubscriptionManager`, created frontend `$suggestedActions` store, integrated with UI (`ChatView`, `MessagesArea`). Fixed syntax errors in related files.

## What's Left
- **Testing (Manual - Streaming Display Fix):** Verify AI responses stream correctly. **(Next Task)**
- **Testing (Manual - Suggested Actions):** Verify suggested actions appear and function correctly.
- **Testing (Manual - Delta Implementation):** Thorough testing of delta updates for history/sessions.
- **Resume Image Upload (Backend & Full Test):** Review/update backend and test.
- **Compliance Review:** Apply `docs/general_guidelines.md`.
- **VS Code Tool Enhancements:** Implement remaining debug tools, enhance `runCommandTool`.
- **UI Refinements & Error Handling:** Ongoing task.
- **Address Timeout (If Needed):** Monitor if timeouts occur.


## Current Status
- Core chat functionality, including persistence for completed/manually stopped messages, is working.
- **Fixed the live streaming display bug** by implementing chunk buffering in the frontend history store.
- State management refactored to Nanostores with delta updates for key areas.
- Acknowledged limitation regarding persistence of partial messages during abrupt window reloads.
- Corrected syntax errors in previously modified files.
- Suggested actions are now managed via Pub/Sub and a dedicated Nanostore. Ready for testing.

## Known Issues / TODOs
- **Persistence on Abrupt Reload:** Partial messages being streamed during an abrupt window reload might be lost due to VS Code's async storage limitations. (Accepted Limitation)
- **Testing:** Manual testing needed for streaming fix, suggested actions, and delta updates.
- **Timeout:** Potential timeout issue during `sendMessage` needs investigation if problems persist.
- **Image Upload:** Backend processing needs verification/completion.
- **(Previous Known Issues Still Apply where relevant)**
