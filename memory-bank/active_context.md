## Current Focus
**Assistant Architecture - Phase 2 (Backend/Stores/UI Implementation):** Verify Assistant CRUD functionality and proceed with full UI implementation and backend integration.

## Next Steps
1.  **Testing:** Verify Assistant CRUD operations (Create, List, Update, Delete) are working correctly via the UI and backend logs.
2.  **Frontend:** Implement the full UI functionality within `AssistantSettings.tsx` (forms, validation, interaction with stores for CRUD).
3.  **Frontend:** Replace placeholder Assistant data/logic in `InputArea.tsx` and `DefaultAssistantSettings.tsx` with integration with the new `assistantStores`.
4.  **Refactor:** Update `ConfigResolver` and `AiStreamer` to use the real `AssistantManager` to fetch Assistant details and apply their configuration (model, instructions).
5.  **Refactor:** Update `ChatSessionManager` to handle `assistantId` in `ChatConfig`.

## Recent Changes
*   Completed systematic UI/UX refactoring based on user principles (minimalism, theme, borderless, etc.). [Resolved]
*   Fixed UI bugs: model selector text, image previews, Assistant settings dropdown cutoff, `CustomSelect` mouse selection. [Resolved]
*   Enhanced `ChatListPage`: Improved delete visibility, added bulk delete UI, added resource placeholder. [Resolved]
*   Pivoted to Assistant architecture: Updated types, refactored relevant frontend components (`InputArea`, `ChatPage`, `SettingPage`, `DefaultAssistantSettings`), created placeholder `AssistantSettings` UI, fixed backend type errors (`configResolver`, `SetDefaultConfigHandler`). [Phase 1 Done]
*   Removed redundant "Default Assistant" card from General Settings. [Done]
*   Implemented backend handlers (`Get`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`) for Assistant management. [Done]
*   Debugged and resolved "No handler found" errors and `assistants/list` timeout by adding logging and removing debounce from `AssistantManager.saveAssistants`. [Done]

## Active Decisions
*   Proceeding with Assistant-based architecture.
*   Prioritize backend/store implementation for Assistants next.
*   File rename `DefaultModelSettings.tsx` -> `DefaultAssistantSettings.tsx` still pending (manual user action).
