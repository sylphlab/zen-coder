# Active Context

## Current Focus
**UI Refactoring:** Starting a systematic review and refactoring of UI views/components in `webview-ui/src` to clean up layout inconsistencies and messy details following a recent overhaul.

## Next Steps
1.  **Review `ChatPage.tsx`:** Read and analyze the main chat page component for layout and code quality issues.
2.  **Review `MessagesArea.tsx`:** Analyze the component displaying chat messages.
3.  **Review `InputArea.tsx`:** Analyze the chat input component.
4.  **Review `ModelSelector.tsx`:** Analyze the model selection component.
5.  **Review `SettingPage.tsx`:** Analyze the main settings page.
6.  **Review Settings Components:** Analyze components under `webview-ui/src/components/settings/`.
7.  **Review Other Components:** Analyze remaining components like `ChatListPage.tsx`, `ConfirmationDialog.tsx`, `ui/CustomSelect.tsx`.
8.  Apply refactoring changes iteratively based on review findings.
